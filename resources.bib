    ABSTRACT           = {Over the last two decades, considerable scientific and technological efforts have been devoted to developing tactile sensing based on a variety of transducing mechanisms, with prospective applications in many fields such as human–machine interaction, intelligent robot tactile control and feedback, and tactile sensorized minimally invasive surgery. This paper starts with an introduction of human tactile systems, followed by a presentation of the basic demands of tactile sensors. State-of-the-art tactile sensors are reviewed in terms of their diverse sensing mechanisms, design consideration, and material selection. Subsequently, typical performances of the sensors, along with their advantages and disadvantages, are compared and analyzed. Two major potential applications of tactile sensing systems are discussed in detail. Lastly, we propose prospective research directions and market trends of tactile sensing systems.},

    ABSTRACT           = {6DoF object pose estimation is a foundation for many important applications, such as robotic grasping, automatic driving, and so on. However, it is very challenging to estimate 6DoF pose of transparent object which is commonly seen in our daily life, because the optical characteristics of transparent material lead to significant depth error which results in false estimation. To solve this problem, a two-stage approach is proposed to estimate 6DoF pose of transparent object from a single RGB-D image. In the first stage, the influence of the depth error is eliminated by transparent segmentation, surface normal recovering, and RANSAC plane estimation. In the second stage, an extended point-cloud representation is presented to accurately and efficiently estimate object pose. As far as we know, it is the first deep learning based approach which focuses on 6DoF pose estimation of transparent objects from a single RGB-D image. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively estimate 6DoF pose of transparent object, and it out-performs the state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin.},

    ABSTRACT           = {6D pose estimation is a common and important task in industry. Obtaining the 6D pose of objects is the basis for many other functions such as bin picking, autopilot, etc. Therefore, many corresponding studies have been made in order to improve the accuracy and enlarge the range of application of various approaches. After several years of development, the methods of 6D pose estimation have been enriched and improved. Although some predecessors have analyzed the methods and summarized them in detailed, there have been many new breakthroughs in recent years. To understand 6D pose estimation better, this paper will make a new and more detailed review of 6D pose estimation. We divided these methods into two approaches: Learning-based approaches and non-learning-based approaches, including 2D-information-based approach and 3D-information-based approach. Additionally, we introduce the challenges that exist in 6D pose estimation. Finally, we compare the performance of different methods qualitatively and discuss the future development trends of the 6D pose estimation.},

    ABSTRACT           = {As flexibility becomes an important factor in factory automation, the bin-picking system, where a robot performs pick-and-place tasks for randomly piled parts in a bin through measuring the 3D pose of an object by a 3D vision sensor, has been actively studied. However, conventional bin-picking systems that are employed for particular tasks are limited by such things as the FOV (Field of View), the shape of landmark features, and computation time. This paper proposes a general-purpose stereo vision based bin-picking system. To detect the workpiece to be picked, a geometric pattern matching (GPM) method with respect to the 2D image with a wide FOV is applied. The accurate 3D pose of a selected workpiece among the pick-up candidates is acquired by measuring the 3D positions of three features in the workpiece using the stereo camera. In order to improve the 3D position estimation performance, the GPM method is also used instead of the stereo matching method. The multiple pattern registration and ellipse fitting techniques are additionally applied to increase the reliability. The grasp position of a workpiece without collision is determined using the pose of the object and the bin information. By using these methods a practical bin-picking strategy is established to operate robustly with minimum help from the human workers in the factory. Through experiments on commercial industrial workpieces and industrial robot, we validated that the proposed vision system accurately measures the 3D pose of part and the robot successfully manipulates the workpiece among randomly stacked parts.},

    ABSTRACT           = {This paper proposes a novel method for six degrees of freedom pose estimation of objects for the application of robot arm pick and place. It is based on the use of a stereo vision system, which does not require calibration. Using both cameras, four corner points of the object are detected. A deep-neural-network (DNN) is trained for the prediction of the 6 DOF pose of the object from the four detected corner points’ coordinates in each image of both cameras. The stereo vision used is a low-end vision system placed in a custom-made setup. Before the training phase of the DNN, the robot is set to auto collect data in a predefined workspace. This workspace is defined dependently on the spatial feasibility of the robot arm and the shared field of view of the stereo vision system. The collected data represent images of a 2D marker attached to the robot arm gripper. The 2D marker is used for data collection to ease the detection of the four corner points. The proposed method succeeds in estimating the six degrees of freedom pose of the object, without the need for the determination of neither the intrinsic nor the extrinsic parameters of the stereo vision system. The optimum design of the proposed DNN is obtained after comparing different activation functions and optimizers associated with the DNN. The proposed uncalibrated DNN-based method performance is compared to that of the traditional calibration-based method. In the calibration-based method, the rotational matrix relating the robot coordinates to the stereo vision coordinates is computed using two approaches. The first approach uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) while the second approach uses a novel proposed modification of particle swarm optimization (PSO) called Hyper particle Scouts optimization (HPSO). HPSO outperforms other metaheuristic optimization algorithms such as PSO and genetic algorithm (GA). Exhaustive tests are performed, and the proposed DNN-based method is shown to outperform all tested alternatives.}

    ABSTRACT           = {This paper addresses the problem of pose estimation from 2D images for textureless industrial metallic parts for a semistructured bin-picking task. The appearance of metallic reflective parts is highly dependent on the camera viewing direction, as well as the distribution of light on the object, making conventional vision-based methods unsuitable for the task. We propose a solution using direct light at a fixed position to the camera, mounted directly on the robot’s gripper, that allows us to take advantage of the reflective properties of the manipulated object.

    ABSTRACT           = {This paper addresses the problem of pose estimation from 2D images for textureless industrial metallic parts for a semistructured bin-picking task. The appearance of metallic reflective parts is highly dependent on the camera viewing direction, as well as the distribution of light on the object, making conventional vision-based methods unsuitable for the task. We propose a solution using direct light at a fixed position to the camera, mounted directly on the robot’s gripper, that allows us to take advantage of the reflective properties of the manipulated object. We propose a data-driven approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), without the need for a hard-coded geometry of the manipulated object.

    ABSTRACT           = {Different models have been used in the literature for the simulation of surface contact in biomechanical knee models. However, there is a lack of systematic comparisons of these models applied to the simulation of a common case, which will provide relevant information about their accuracy and suitability for application in models of the implanted knee. In this work a comparison of the Hertz model (HM), the elastic foundation model (EFM) and the finite element model (FEM) for the simulation of the elastic contact in a 3D model of the prosthetic knee is presented. From the results of this comparison it is found that although the nature of the EFM offers advantages when compared with that of the HM for its application to realistic prosthetic surfaces, and when compared with the FEM in CPU time, its predictions can differ from FEM in some circumstances. These differences are considerable if the comparison is performed for prescribed displacements, although they are less important for prescribed loads. To solve these problems a new modified elastic foundation model (mEFM) is proposed that maintains basically the simplicity of the original model while producing much more accurate results. In this paper it is shown that this new mEFM calculates pressure distribution and contact area with accuracy and short computation times for toroidal contacting surfaces. Although further work is needed to confirm its validity for more complex geometries the mEFM is envisaged as a good option for application in 3D knee models to predict prosthetic knee performance.}

    ABSTRACT           = { A new theory in contact mechanics for modeling of soft fingers is proposed to define the relationship between the normal force and the radius of contact for soft fingers by considering general soft-finger materials, including linearly and nonlinearly elastic materials. The results show that the radius of contact is proportional to the normal force raised to the power of, which ranges from 0 to 1/3. This new theory subsumes the Hertzian contact model for linear elastic materials, where D 1/3. Experiments are conducted to validate the theory using artificial soft fingers made of various materials such as rubber and silicone. Results for human fingers are also compared. This theory provides a basis for numerically constructing friction limit surfaces. The numerical friction limit surface can be approximated by an ellipse, with the major and minor axes as the maximum friction force and the maximum moment with respect to the normal axis of contact, respectively. Combining the results of the contactmechanics model with the contact-pressure distribution, the normalized friction limit surface can be derived for anthropomorphic soft fingers. The results of the contact-mechanics model and the pressure distribution for soft fingers facilitate the construction of numerical friction limit surfaces, and will enable us to analyze and simulate contact behaviors of grasping and manipulation in robotics. }

    ABSTRACT           = {In this paper the contact problem between a rigid indenter of arbitrary shape and a viscoelastic half-space is considered. Under the action of a normal force the penetration of the indenter and the distribution of contact pressure change. We wish to find the relations which link the pressure distribution, the resultant force on the indenter and the penetration on the assumption that the surfaces are frictionless. For indenters of arbitrary shape the problem may be solved numerically by using the Matrix Inversion Method (MIM), extended to viscoelastic case. In this method the boundary conditions are satisfied exactly at specified “matching points” (the mid-points of the boundary elements). It can be validated by comparing the numerical results to the analytic solutions in cases of a spherical asperity (loading and unloading) and a conical asperity (loading only). Finally, the method was implemented for a finite cylindrical shape with its curved face indenting the surface of the half-space.

    ABSTRACT           = {We outline a general approach for extending the classical Boussinesq's solution to the case of pressures distributed according to a polynomial law of arbitrary order over a polygonal domain. To this end we exploit a generalized version of the Gauss theorem and recent results of potential theory which consistently take into account the singularities affecting the expressions of the fields of interest, an issue which seems to have been overlooked in the existing literature. For linearly varying pressures we derive analytical expressions of displacements, strains and stresses at an arbitrary point of the half-space as a function of the loading function and of the position vectors which define the boundary of the loaded region. We briefly discuss how bilinear and more general pressure distributions can be accommodated in our formulation since the paper is mainly motivated by the interest in developing efficient computational tools for solving 3D problems in foundation engineering and contact mechanics. Finally, comparisons with existing solutions and numerical examples are discussed.},

The first is based on using the exact stiffness, consistent mass, and geometric stiffness matrices for a beam on a variable Winkler elastic foundation. The second method is based on adding an element foundation stiffness matrix to the regular beam stiffness matrix, for vibrations and stability analysis. With these matrices, it is possible to find the natural frequencies and mode shapes of vibrations, and buckling load and mode shape, by using a small number of segments. It is concluded that the use of the element foundation stiffness approach yields better convergence at lower computation costs.}

    ABSTRACT           = {The influences of a Winkler elastic foundation modulus, slenderness ratio and elastically restrained boundary conditions on the critical load of a Timoshenko beam subjected to an end follower force are investigated. The characteristic equation for elastic stability is derived. It is found that the critical flutter load for the cantilever Timoshenko beam will first decrease as the elastic foundation modulus is increased and when the elastic foundation modulus is greater than the corresponding critical value, which corresponds to the lowest critical load, it will increase, instead. In particular, if the elastic foundation modulus is large enough, the critical flutter load for the cantilever Timoshenko beam can be greater than that of the Bernoulli-Euler beam. For a clamped-translational or clamped-rotational elastic spring supported beam resting on an elastic foundation, there exists a critical value of the spring constant for each beam. At this critical point, the critical load jumps and the type of instability mechanism changes. The jump mechanisms for beams resting on elastic foundations of different modulus values are different.}

The method is useful for describing how a grasp will behave in the presence of external forces (e.g., when and how the fingertips will slide) and for planning how to control the fingers so that the grasped object will follow a desired trajectory. The sliding trajectories are characterized by a transient and steady-state solution. The underlying theory is first dis cussed and illustrated with several single-finger examples. Experimental results are also presented. The analysis is then extended to grasps with multiple sliding and nonslid ing fingers. The multifinger analysis is illustrated with an example of manipulating a card with two soft-contact fingers. }

Next we provide experimental results showing that the limit surface only approximates the actual force-motion relationship. Then we look at other approximations that can be used to provide a simplified model useful in control, planning, and simulation of manipulation. These approximations include square pyramids, cones, ellipsoids, and ellipsoids with facets removed. Different approximations may be most appropriate, depending on the required computational speed and accuracy and the need to produce conservative results. }

    ABSTRACT           = {Computational wear prediction is an attractive concept for evaluating new total knee replacement designs prior to physical testing and implementation. An important hurdle to such technology is the lack of in vivo contact pressure predictions. To address this issue, this study evaluates a computationally efficient simulation approach that combines the advantages of rigid and deformable body modeling. The hybrid method uses rigid body dynamics to predict body positions and orientations and elastic foundation theory to predict contact pressures between general three-dimensional surfaces. To evaluate the method, we performed static pressure experiments with a commercial knee implant in neutral alignment using flexion angles of 0, 30, 60, and 90° and loads of 750, 1500, 2250, and 3000N. Using manufacturer CAD geometry for the same implant, an elastic foundation model with linear or nonlinear polyethylene material properties was implemented within a commercial multibody dynamics software program. The model's ability to predict experimental peak and average contact pressures simultaneously was evaluated by performing dynamic simulations to find the static configuration. Both the linear and nonlinear material models predicted the average contact pressure data well, while only the linear material model could simultaneously predict the trends in the peak contact pressure data. This novel modeling approach is sufficiently fast and accurate to be used in design sensitivity and optimization studies of knee implant mechanics and ultimately wear.}

    ABSTRACT           = {Wear of components is often a critical factor influencing the product service life. Wear prediction is therefore an important part of engineering. The wear simulation approach with commercial finite element (FE) software ANSYS is presented in this paper. A modelling and simulation procedure is proposed and used with the linear wear law and the Euler integration scheme. Good care, however, must be taken to assure model validity and numerical solution convergence. A spherical pin-on-disc unlubricated steel contact was analysed both experimentally and with FEM, and the Lim and Ashby wear map was used to identify the wear mechanism. It was shown that the FEA wear simulation results of a given geometry and loading can be treated on the basis of wear coefficient-sliding distance change equivalence. The finite element software ANSYS is well suited for the solving of contact problems as well as the wear simulation. The actual scatter of the wear coefficient being within the limits of $\pm$40-60\% led to considerable deviation of wear simulation results. These results must therefore be evaluated on a relative scale to compare different design options.}

    ABSTRACT           = {AbstractA tool has been developed for contact mechanics analysis of the wheel-rail contact. Using measurements of wheel and rail profiles as input, the tool is based on the finite element (FE) code ANSYS. Traditionally, two methods have been used to investigate the rail-wheel contact, namely Hertz's analytical method and Kalker's software program Contact. Both are based on the half-space assumption as well as on a linear-elastic material model. The half-space assumption puts geometrical limitations on the contact. This means that the significant dimensions of the contact area must be small compared with the relative radii of the curvature of each body. Especially in the gauge corner of the rail profile, the half-space assumption is questionable since the contact radius here can be as small as 10 mm. By using the FE method (FEM) the user is not limited by these two assumptions. The profile measurement system Miniprof was used to measure the wheel and rail profiles that were used as input when generating the FE mesh.As a test case, a sharp curve (303 m radius) in a unidirectional commuter train track used by X1 and X10 trains was chosen. The results of two contact cases were compared with the results of the Hertz analytical method and the program Contact. In the first contact case the wheel was in contact with the rail gauge corner. In the second case the wheel was in contact with the rail head. In both contact cases Hertz and Contact presented very similar results for the maximum contact pressure. For the first contact case, a significant difference was found between the FE method and the Hertz method and the program Contact in all of output data. The Hertz and Contact methods both presented a maximum contact pressure that was three times larger (around 3 GPa) than the FE solution. Here, the difference was probably due to the combination of both the half-space assumption and the elastic-plastic material model. For the second contact case, there was no significant difference between the maximum contact pressure results of the three different contact mechanics methods employed. }

    ABSTRACT           = {Finite element method (FEM) is a numerical technique to obtain an approximate solution for problems involving elliptical partial differential equation by dividing the domain into n no of parts of smaller size and applying the boundary conditions to them. In more advance way, it is the analysis of any structure by dividing the whole body into number of small elements and applying the constraints and loads on them and finding the unknowns as per our analysis and the whole analysis are done by the software itself. Initially, the FEM concept was used for solving mathematical formulations in easier way but the development of the FEM concepts and various FEM software, like NASTRAN, ANSYS, etc., made its applications to reach into fields of statistical analysis of structures, linear and non-linear analysis, heat transfer problems and also in bio engineering, nuclear engineering, metallurgical and much more, and this is possible due to the advance types of element in the FEM software. So in the research, the origin and the history of FEM is been studied and the contribution of various researchers has been shown which gives a very clear development idea of FEM and applications of FEM in daily engineering applications from past date till today. The idea of discretization is very old, the mathematical papers on FEA by Schelbach and Courant show the same approach. Earlier, before 1922, also Courant used the finite element ideas in Dirchlet's principle. The FEM we use today involves the contribution of many researchers, namely Turner, Clough, Martin and Topp, Argyris, Bubuska, Aziz, Irons, Melosh and many more, like M. J. Turner at being perfected the direct stiffness method, clough coined the term `Finite Elements', contribution of B. M. Irons towards FEA was the introduction of shape functions, patch test, text books by Huges and Bathe, Zienkiewicz laid the foundation for further advancement of FEM, and thus the period of 1962--1972 is known as the golden age of FEM and so on.},

    ABSTRACT           = {Aiming at the problem of flexible sliding tactile sensing for the actual grasp of intelligent robot fingers, a double-layer sliding tactile sensor based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) for robot fingers is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the optimal embedding depth range of FBG in the elastic matrix of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was determined through finite element analysis and static detection experiments of finger tactile sensing. Secondly, the sensor structure is optimized and designed through the simulation and dynamic experiments of sliding sensing to determine the final array structure. Thirdly, the sensing array is actually pasted on the surface of the robot finger and the sensing characteristics testing platform is built to test and analyze the basic performance of the sliding tactile sensor. Then, the sensor array is actually attached to the finger surface of the robot and the sensing characteristics testing platform is built to experiment and analyze the basic performance of the sliding tactile sensor. Finally, a sliding tactile sensing experiment of robot finger grasping is conducted. The experimental results show that the sliding tactile sensor designed in this paper has good repeatability and creep resistance, with sensitivities of 12.4 pm/N, 11.6 pm/N, and 14.5 pm/N, respectively, and the overall deviation is controlled within 5 pm. Meanwhile, it can effectively sense the signals of the robot fingers during static contact and sliding. The sensor has a high degree of fit with the robot finger structure, and has certain application value for the perception of sliding tactile signals in the object grasping of intelligent robot objects.},
