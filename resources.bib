    abstract       = {over the last two decades, considerable scientific and technological efforts have been devoted to developing tactile sensing based on a variety of transducing mechanisms, with prospective applications in many fields such as humanâ€“machine interaction, intelligent robot tactile control and feedback, and tactile sensorized minimally invasive surgery. this paper starts with an introduction of human tactile systems, followed by a presentation of the basic demands of tactile sensors. state-of-the-art tactile sensors are reviewed in terms of their diverse sensing mechanisms, design consideration, and material selection. subsequently, typical performances of the sensors, along with their advantages and disadvantages, are compared and analyzed. two major potential applications of tactile sensing systems are discussed in detail. lastly, we propose prospective research directions and market trends of tactile sensing systems.},
