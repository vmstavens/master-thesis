    ABSTRACT       = {Over the last two decades, considerable scientific and technological efforts have been devoted to developing tactile sensing based on a variety of transducing mechanisms, with prospective applications in many fields such as humanâ€“machine interaction, intelligent robot tactile control and feedback, and tactile sensorized minimally invasive surgery. This paper starts with an introduction of human tactile systems, followed by a presentation of the basic demands of tactile sensors. State-of-the-art tactile sensors are reviewed in terms of their diverse sensing mechanisms, design consideration, and material selection. Subsequently, typical performances of the sensors, along with their advantages and disadvantages, are compared and analyzed. Two major potential applications of tactile sensing systems are discussed in detail. Lastly, we propose prospective research directions and market trends of tactile sensing systems.},

    ABSTRACT       = {6DoF object pose estimation is a foundation for many important applications, such as robotic grasping, automatic driving, and so on. However, it is very challenging to estimate 6DoF pose of transparent object which is commonly seen in our daily life, because the optical characteristics of transparent material lead to significant depth error which results in false estimation. To solve this problem, a two-stage approach is proposed to estimate 6DoF pose of transparent object from a single RGB-D image. In the first stage, the influence of the depth error is eliminated by transparent segmentation, surface normal recovering, and RANSAC plane estimation. In the second stage, an extended point-cloud representation is presented to accurately and efficiently estimate object pose. As far as we know, it is the first deep learning based approach which focuses on 6DoF pose estimation of transparent objects from a single RGB-D image. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively estimate 6DoF pose of transparent object, and it out-performs the state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin.},

    ABSTRACT       = {6D pose estimation is a common and important task in industry. Obtaining the 6D pose of objects is the basis for many other functions such as bin picking, autopilot, etc. Therefore, many corresponding studies have been made in order to improve the accuracy and enlarge the range of application of various approaches. After several years of development, the methods of 6D pose estimation have been enriched and improved. Although some predecessors have analyzed the methods and summarized them in detailed, there have been many new breakthroughs in recent years. To understand 6D pose estimation better, this paper will make a new and more detailed review of 6D pose estimation. We divided these methods into two approaches: Learning-based approaches and non-learning-based approaches, including 2D-information-based approach and 3D-information-based approach. Additionally, we introduce the challenges that exist in 6D pose estimation. Finally, we compare the performance of different methods qualitatively and discuss the future development trends of the 6D pose estimation.},
