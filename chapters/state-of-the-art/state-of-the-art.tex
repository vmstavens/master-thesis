\section{Problem 1 - Tactile Perception} \label{sec:lit-rev-problem-1}

% What are contact models and what do they describe?
For tactile perception we need to model the contact between the robotic manipulator finger and the object.

% How are models grouped and what groupings exist?

Contact models can be grouped based on the what parameters the relation is describing.

% Contact Area vs. Applied Force


% Hertzian contact model

% Soft Contact Model (More general Hertzian model)

% Viscoelastic Soft Contact Model.

% 	 Kelvin–Voigt/Maxwell model
% 	  Fung’s model

% Other contact models (research)



% Boussinesq–Cerruti’s

% Love’s solution

What is tactile perception? Why is it relevant? \\
How is a tactile sensor constructed \cite{recent-progress-in-technologies-for-tactile-sensors}
what different types exist and which one is present in the model provided.
