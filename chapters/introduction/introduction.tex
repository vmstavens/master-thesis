% Subject matter terms are addressed with \texttt{\textbackslash gls\{glossary-label\}} like so \gls{glossary-label}. \\
% Acronyms are addressed with either with their long equivalent \texttt{\textbackslash acrlong\{gls-label\}} which gives \acrlong{acronym-label}
% or the short equivalent \texttt{\textbackslash acrshort\{gls-label\}} which gives \acrshort{acronym-label}. \\
% Subject matter terms can also be multi structure \texttt{\textbackslash gls\{glossary-multi-label\}} which gives \gls{glossary-multi-label} (see terms and acronyms above). \medskip

The developments in robotics as a field has over the past years provided automation solutions to execute repetitive manual tasks with high efficiency and reliability \fakecite. One of the most common tasks being pick and place tasks which involves picking un an object from one position and placing is in another. This is can be parted into the following subparts: Object localization, pose estimation, grasping and placing. In the solutions currently present for industrial use \gls{cv} is used for object localization and \gls{pe} due to the low cost of cameras and the fields maturity. However, while these solutions may be sufficient for certain tasks they fundamentally suffer from the weaknesses introduced by vision techniques. These include a great number of outliers caused by occlusions, reflecting, transparent or homogeneous surfaces, and repetitive structures when solving the \gls{corr-problem}. These problems as of the writing of this project have jet to be completely solved. Promising results have been found with the rise of \gls{dl} which in present time has proven its versatility and provides proof of concept solutions for narrow cases in pose estimation of transparent \cite{6dof-pose-estimation-of-transparent-object-from-a-single-rgb-d-image} and reflective objects \cite{6d-pose-estimation-of-objects:-recent-technologies-and-challenges}. This is relevant since industrial settings often contain transparent and especially reflecting objects as metallic parts tend to appear frequently and have high reflectances. \medskip

	To solve these problems this project aims to perform in-hand pose estimation through only the use of tactile sensors. Specifically this will be done on a Shadow Dexterous Hand \cite{shadow-dex-hand} with 20 \gls{dof}. Using tactile inputs rather than visual, eliminates the weaknesses mentioned above. A schematic showing the hand can be seen in \figref{fig:shadow-dex-hand-schematic}. Using this approach, the overall problem can be partitioned into 3 sub-problems labeled problem 1, 2 and 3. Problem 1 involves modeling the contact between the gripper's fingers and the object, also referred to as tactile perception. Problem 2 is to convert the collected data from problem 1 to meaningful surface data, treat these data as features and use them to estimate pose candidates. Finally problem 3 involves in-hand manipulation, such that further information is gained by probing the object. Here new desired surface points are found such that strong surface features are found to better identify the object's correct pose. 
	The development of this project is done in the \gls{docker} provided by Shadow Robotics for simulation, control and development of the hand \cite{shadow-dex-github}. Here a hardware-simulation agnostic \gls{ros}\fakecite control\fakecite interface is provided, which provides fundamental tools to interact with the robot hand. \medskip
